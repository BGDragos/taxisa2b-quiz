## Credits

- I started this project in 05/11/2022 and I have been working for many hours, maybe is something small not very attractive and for professionals is very basic and easy, but I really like how resonding and I accomplished 90% from what I planned befor starting ideea.
- I used header and footer snippet from my first project, that project it was also my work, and now I tried to keep the same style, because at the end of the cours, I want an operational <i>Full Project</i> that I planed.
- I started learning and writing code after I have been enrolled with <b>Code Institute</b> and this is my second project where I spent many hours and is mainly by scratch, of course after research and maybe using similar syntaxes offered by training team along the section.
- I watched youtube to understand de syntax and I can confirm that still need to return back to Javascript section just to dig deep.
- Today 09/11/2022 I writing this <i>README.md</i> and I am proud with my work.

### Content

- I am 100% sure that my work is not accurate and can be improved but I checked watching again videos presented by mentors and I am going to dig deep to understand more.
- I used copy-paste during the project just for snipping some helpful content mentioned below:
- Copied some of the function from JavaScript content presented by <b>[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)</b>

    - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
    - [Code Institut](https://codeinstitute.net/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - [Am-I-Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
    - [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yS-JV4fWqY)
    - [TaxisA2B Project](https://bgdragos.github.io/taxisa2b/). This project it was developed by me the owner and I used some of the code from header and footer.
 
 - I've looked after to understand much better the way how code is working using the link below:
 
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    - [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

  - I got all the majorities of ideas from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) but I applied much more modifications and different meanings.

### Media

  - I found during the coding of this project lots of issues for operationality of each picture and  how to make functions from javascript responding to the media that I used.. Now I am happy how everything's looking.
  
  - All the pictures used in this <i>TAXISA2B QUIZ</i> are captured using the basic screenshot while I used <b><i>Google Map View</i></b> 

  - Template for this <i>README.md</i> is [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) property, I developer for this project, I am using only for presentation and I changed the content only for learning purpose.
  - Text was written by me, person who developed this <i>QUIZ</i> no copy-paste taken from different sources.

### <i> Validator Testing</i>

- HTML
  - I could found minor errors for mistyping or adding to many open tags or forgetting to close tags [W3C validator]()

  - After careful look I fixed all of them and now performances are above 90%.

  ![W3C HTML]()

- CSS
  - I could found minor errors for mistyping or adding to many open tags, double writing the code for some of <b>id</b> , <b>class</b> or forgetting to close tags [(Jigsaw) validator]()

  - After careful look I fixed all of them and now the CSS file is not presenting any error.

  ![W3C CSS]()

  - JavaScript
  - I could found minor errors for forgeting to call some of the functions or mistyping <b>"; - colons"</b> [(JSHint) tool](https://jshint.com/)

  - After careful look I fixed almost all of them, one function <i><b>clickIt()</b></i> is not used/called because that's make my quiz running badly and I don't know how to call silent.


### <i>Unfixed Bugs</i>

- My code using <i>Developer Tool</i> not presenting any error, but after all the function are called and last question is answered and Quiz ending I can see showing the following: <i><b> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'image') </b></i>
 Some of the notions probably will become easier in the next chapters.
  - After careful checking on internet I could see very experienced developers with same error as well.
 - My Quiz developed with help from the course offered by <b>Code Institute</b> not presenting any other error and game area running smoothly I believe.

## Testing

- Using the Lighthouse offered by browser in DevTool, I fixed viewings in different screen sizes.

- Markup Validation Service for HTML

- CSS Validation Service.

- Using JSHint I discoverd some of the mistyping syntax.

- For applying all the changes in <b>Gitpod</b> and check how website responding, I used the server online mentioned by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) <i>python3 -m http.server.</i>

## Deployment

- After finishing my project I followed cople of easy stepts:
  - I added any page or modified page to git (<b>git add .</b>)
  - I committed any Update followed by relevant information (<b>git commit -m "...relevant message..."</b>)
  - I pushed all the work to <i>GitHub</i> using (<b>git push</b>)
  - After we see our site available in <i>GitHub Website</i>
       - We are looking for our repositories
       - We go in last pushed project
       - Selecting <i>Settings > Pages > Source > Build and deployment</i>
       - From selected <i>Build and deployment > Deploy from a branch</i> 
       - Under selection <i>Deploy from a branch</i> select from the box <i>main</i> or depending any profile, I have listed only <i>main</i>
       - After selection <i>main</i> + <i>/root</i> + <i>save</i>
       - We're waiting few minutes to create the website page and after proceed to submit our the project.
