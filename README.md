## Credits

- I started this project in 22/09/2022 it's hard to know exect time until I finish because I started from scratch, I checked "LOVE RUNNING" and "Coders Coffeehouse" presented by our teachers/mentors.
Today 29/09/2022 I writing this <i>README.md</i> and I am proud with my work.

### Content

- I am 100% sure that my work is not accurate but I checked watching again videos presented by mentors and I am going to dig deep to understand more.
- I used copy-paste during the project just for snipping some helpful content mentioned below:

    - [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
    - [Google-Map-Generator](https://google-map-generator.com/)
    - [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - [Am-I-Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive)
 
 - I've looked after to understand much better the way how code is working using the link below:
 
    - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

  - I got all the majorities of ideas from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) but I applied much more modifications and different meaning.

### Media

  - I found during the coding of this project lots of issues for view in different screen sizes. Now I am happy how everything's looking.
  
  - All the pictures used in this <i>website</i> are under my ownership.

  - Template for this <i>README.md</i> is [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) property, I TAXISA2B, I am using only for presentation and I changed the content only for learning purpose.
  - Text was written by me, person who developed this website no copy-paste taken from different sources.

### <i> Validator Testing</i>

- HTML
  - I could found minor errors for mistyping or adding to many open tags or forgetting to close tags [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fbgdragos.github.io%2Ftaxisa2b%2Fabout.html)

  - After careful look I fixed all of them and now performances are after 90%.

### <i>Unfixed Bugs</i>

- Couple of issues for smaller screen size, I fixed big majority, Google DevTools asked for some <i>json</i> files and that's new for me.
 Some of the notions probably will become easier in the next chapters.

## Testing

- Using the Lighthouse tests I could see lots of issues for viewing pictures in different resolution

- I used <b>DevTools</b> offered by <b>Google</b> I applied all the changes and I wrote everything in <b>Gitpod</b> where is an internal <b>Visual Studio Code</b>

- For applying all the changes in <b>Gitpod</b> and check how website responding, I used the server mentioned by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) in online learning process.

## Deployment

- After finishing my project I followed cople of easy stepts:
  - I added any page or modified page to git (<b>git add .</b>)
  - I committed any Update followed by relevant information (<b>git commit -m "...relevant message..."</b>)
  - I pushed all the work to <i>GitHub</i> using (<b>git push</b>)
  - After we see our site available in <i>GitHub Website</i>
       - We are looking for our repositories
       - We go in last pushed project
       - Selecting <i>Settings > Pages > Source > Build and deployment</i>
       - From selected <i>Build and deployment > Deploy from a branch</i> 
       - Under selection <i>Deploy from a branch</i> select from the box <i>main</i> or depending any profile, I have listed only <i>main</i>
       - After selection <i>main</i> + <i>/root</i> + <i>save</i>
